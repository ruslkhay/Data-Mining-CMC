# Detailed Analysis of Forecasting Algorithms and Methods

This notebook implements a comprehensive workflow for building regression models to predict donation amounts for veterans' organizations. Let me explain each section in detail, focusing on the algorithms, methods, and their applications.

## Initial Setup (Cell 1)

The first cell imports necessary libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning:

- **Data manipulation tools**: pandas and numpy for data handling and numerical operations
- **Visualization tools**: matplotlib and seaborn for creating plots and visualizations
- **Scikit-learn components**:
  - Model selection tools (train_test_split, cross_val_score, KFold) for data splitting and validation
  - Preprocessing modules (StandardScaler, PowerTransformer) for feature scaling and transformation
  - KNNImputer for handling missing values
  - Linear models (LassoLars, LassoLarsCV, LinearRegression, Ridge) for regression tasks
  - Metrics (mean_squared_error, r2_score) for model evaluation
  - Pipeline for creating workflow sequences
  - PolynomialFeatures for generating polynomial features
  - HalvingRandomSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter tuning

The random seed is set to 42 to ensure reproducibility of results.

## Sub-task 1: Data Exploration

This section loads and explores the "donations.csv" dataset, which contains information about participants in veterans' organization donation programs. The dataset includes:

- Socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, income, homeownership)
- Behavioral characteristics (donation history, advertising contacts)
- Response variables: TargetB (whether they donated) and TargetD (donation amount)

The exploration process includes:
1. Displaying basic information about the dataset (shape, data types)
2. Examining summary statistics
3. Checking for missing values
4. Filtering the dataset to focus only on records where people donated (TargetB == 1)
5. Visualizing the distribution of donation amounts using histograms

This initial exploration helps understand the data structure and characteristics before model building.

## Sub-task 2: Data Splitting and Visualization

This task implements stratified sampling to create training and holdout datasets:

1. **Discretization of TargetD**: The continuous response variable is discretized into 5 bins using pd.qcut(), which creates bins of equal population (quantiles). This allows for stratified sampling based on the donation amount.

2. **Stratified Split**: train_test_split() with stratify parameter ensures the bins are proportionally represented in both training (70%) and holdout (30%) sets.

3. **Distribution Visualization**: The distribution of donation amounts is visualized across the entire dataset, training set, and holdout set using histograms and kernel density estimation (KDE).

This approach ensures that the training and holdout sets have similar distributions of the target variable, which is crucial for model evaluation.

## Sub-task 3: Data Preprocessing

This task involves comprehensive data preprocessing:

1. **Missing Value Handling**:
   - Binary indicators are created for columns with missing values (flagging which observations had missing data)
   - KNNImputer with n_neighbors=7 is used to impute missing values for numeric features
   - This method fills missing values based on the values of K nearest neighbors in the feature space

2. **Feature Transformation**:
   - Skewed numeric features (with skewness > 1) are transformed using Box-Cox transformation via PowerTransformer
   - For features with non-positive values, a log1p transformation is applied after shifting
   - These transformations make the feature distributions more symmetric, which benefits many ML algorithms

3. **Categorical Feature Encoding**:
   - Target encoding: Each category is replaced with the mean of the target variable for that category
   - Threshold encoding: A binary variable is created indicating if the category's mean target is above the median

These preprocessing steps address missing values and transform both numeric and categorical features to make them more suitable for regression algorithms.

## Sub-task 4: Feature Selection with LASSO_LARS

This task uses LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) with LARS (Least Angle Regression) for feature selection:

1. **Data Preparation**: The prepare_data_for_model function extracts all transformed features and remaining numeric features, then standardizes them using StandardScaler.

2. **LASSO_LARS with Cross-Validation**: 
   - LassoLarsCV with 5-fold cross-validation automatically selects the optimal regularization parameter (alpha)
   - This method fits the model at various levels of regularization and selects the one that minimizes cross-validated MSE

3. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Different alpha values are used to fit LassoLars models and measure complexity (number of non-zero coefficients)
   - For each model, cross-validation MSE is calculated
   - This produces a profile of model performance vs. complexity

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plots showing CV-MSE vs. model complexity help identify the optimal trade-off
   - Coefficient trajectories show how feature importance changes with regularization strength
   - The optimal model complexity is marked with a vertical line

5. **Final Model Evaluation**:
   - A linear regression model is trained using only the selected features
   - Performance metrics (R-squared, MSE) are calculated for both training and holdout sets
   - Out-of-bag (OOB) error is estimated using cross-validation

LASSO_LARS is particularly useful for feature selection because it tends to drive coefficients of less important features exactly to zero while retaining important ones.

## Sub-task 5: Bootstrapping for Model Stability

This task uses bootstrapping to assess model stability:

1. **Bootstrap Implementation**:
   - 100 bootstrap samples are created, each using 25% of the original training data
   - For each sample, a linear regression model is trained, and the intercept (bias constant) is recorded
   - Out-of-bag (OOB) error is calculated using samples not included in each bootstrap iteration

2. **Intercept Distribution Analysis**:
   - A histogram of bootstrap intercepts shows the distribution of the bias constant
   - The mean and 95% confidence interval are calculated and visualized
   - This provides insight into the stability of the model's baseline prediction

3. **Error Comparison**:
   - Bootstrap OOB MSE is compared with cross-validation MSE and holdout MSE
   - A histogram of OOB errors from bootstrap samples is plotted
   - This helps assess how consistently the model performs across different subsets of data

Bootstrapping provides insights into model stability and uncertainty that aren't captured by single-point estimates.

## Sub-task 6: Nonlinear Modeling with Polynomial Ridge Regression

This task implements a nonlinear model using polynomial features and ridge regularization:

1. **Polynomial Ridge Pipeline**:
   - A pipeline is created with three stages: PolynomialFeatures, StandardScaler, and Ridge
   - This generates polynomial interactions, standardizes them, and applies ridge regularization

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - HalvingRandomSearchCV is used to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space
   - Parameters tuned include polynomial degree (2-3) and regularization strength (alpha)
   - This method uses a "successive halving" approach where promising configurations receive more resources

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - The best model is evaluated on the holdout set
   - Performance is compared with the linear model from previous tasks
   - Bootstrap OOB error is calculated for the nonlinear model for additional comparison

HalvingRandomSearchCV is an efficient alternative to traditional RandomizedSearchCV, as it allocates more computational resources to promising hyperparameter configurations, making the search more efficient.

## Sub-task 7: Model Comparison and Visualization

This final task provides comprehensive model evaluation and comparison:

1. **Hyperparameter Lattice Visualization**:
   - A scatter plot shows how model performance varies with different hyperparameter combinations
   - Point color indicates performance (MSE)
   - Point size shows the iteration in the halving search (larger points survived more rounds)

2. **Performance Metric Comparison**:
   - Bar charts compare MSE and R-squared between linear and nonlinear models
   - Metrics included: CV MSE, OOB MSE, Training MSE, Holdout MSE, Training R², Holdout R²

3. **Residual Analysis**:
   - Residual plots help diagnose whether models capture all systematic patterns in data
   - Comparing residuals between models highlights differences in prediction characteristics

4. **Actual vs. Predicted Visualization**:
   - Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted values show how well models fit the data
   - These plots help identify regions of overprediction or underprediction

5. **Comprehensive Conclusions**:
   - Detailed analysis of model performance across metrics
   - Assessment of overfitting risk and generalization ability
   - Consistency between different evaluation methods (CV, OOB, holdout)
   - Final recommendations based on performance and complexity trade-offs

This extensive comparison helps make an informed decision about which model to deploy, considering not just overall performance but also stability, complexity, and potential overfitting.

## Key Algorithms and Methods Explained

1. **KNN Imputation**: Replaces missing values with the average of K nearest neighbors in feature space, preserving local patterns in the data.

2. **Box-Cox Transformation**: A power transformation that makes skewed data more normal-like, which improves model performance when algorithms assume normally distributed features.

3. **Target Encoding**: Maps categorical variables to numeric values based on the mean target value for each category, creating informative numeric features while avoiding excessive dimensionality.

4. **LASSO_LARS**: Combines LASSO regularization with LARS algorithm for efficient feature selection, driving unimportant feature coefficients to exactly zero.

5. **Cross-Validation**: Evaluates model performance across multiple data splits, providing a robust estimate of generalization performance.

6. **Bootstrapping**: Resampling technique that estimates the distribution of model parameters and performance metrics, revealing model stability.

7. **Polynomial Features**: Captures nonlinear relationships by adding polynomial terms and interaction effects to the feature space.

8. **Ridge Regularization**: Shrinks coefficients toward zero to prevent overfitting, especially important with polynomial features which can lead to complex models.

9. **HalvingRandomSearchCV**: Efficiently explores hyperparameter space by allocating more resources to promising configurations, implementing a tournament-style elimination.

10. **Residual Analysis**: Diagnoses model fit by examining the distribution and patterns of prediction errors.
